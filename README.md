# coding-examples

This repo is a holding area for toy code I have used for educational purposes in my career. It contains three folders:
* coding-excercises: These are little Python scripts that I have coded to slove LeetCode and other learning challenges
* coding-for-kids: Python scripts to demo the world of coding and Arduino to elementary and middle school children
* Jupyter: Jupyter notesbooks to solve puzzels and games mostly for my children and myself
